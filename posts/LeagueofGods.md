League of Gods is the first movie I worked on.

I had the opportunity to work with a talented and smart team of artists mainly consisted of animators, 3D modelers, and compositors.

I had to work mostly on 3 types of effects using four different programs

### Snake eyes

For this effect I had to search on the internet for a clear image of a snake or a cat's eye. 

In `After Effects` I tracked the actress' eyes, roto her iris and eyelids, and objects getting on top of her eyes. 
Added some color correction to match the real image.
I also collaborated with the modelers and animaters by doing rotos of the hands with `Mocha Pro`

### Negative Eyes

This effect was very similar to the previous one but instead of replacing the real eyes I had to roto the iris and apply an inverted effect.

### Energy aura

I used `Maya` to create simple shapes that represented the body of the main character then animated them to match the plate. After that I emitted particles from the shapes, created physical forces to simulate the environment and finally used `Krakatoa` to make it look better
