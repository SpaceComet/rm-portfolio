For Higher Power I helped artist by developing scripts that made 
the process more efficient and procedural saving them a lot of time.
I set up the AWS computers to meet the deadline and develop tools for the 
system to make the process of syncing and managing the renders easier.
I also worked in shots related to monitor comps, tracking, rotoscope, and greenscreen.
