Seeds was a very fun movie to work on. 
In this movie I got to learn how 3D face Scanning process works.
I worked on dynamics and simulation of ants for most of the time.
In addition some cleaning and roto work.

### Ants

First, our team contacted one of the main characters in the movie ([Trevor Long](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0519217/?ref_=nm_mv_close))
Set up the environment to take advantage of natural sun light, marked his face with different symbols and then took 
a lot of pictures of his face. We uploaded the pictures to an website that generated the 3D object of his face. My coworker [Huascar Torales](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9746491/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr44) retopologize the model. 
In `After effects` I stabilized the original plate, imported it into `Maya`, repositioned the camera and the objects, then animated the objects when necessary (for cases when his chest move because of breathing)
Finally emitted particles from the mesh and then animated them with `MEL` (the native programming language of `Maya`)
